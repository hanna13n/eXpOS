[oureXpOS](https://github.com/heckerfr0d/myexpos) has stage-wise versions of the project. 

### Overview
eXpOS is a small operating system written from scratch. The eXpOS runs on a simulated string machine called [XSM (eXperimental String Machine)](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/arch-spec/). The OS is programmed using a custom language known as [SPL (System Programmer's Language)](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/support-tools/spl/) and application programs, which run on the OS, are programmed using [Expl (Experimental Language)](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/support-tools/expl/).
